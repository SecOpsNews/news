# How to contribute

I like to encourage you to contribute to the repository.
This should be as easy as possible for you but there are a few things to consider when contributing.
The following guidelines for contribution should be followed if you want to submit an issue, bug or feature request.

## How to prepare

* You need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit an [issue ticket](https://github.com/SecOpsNews/news/issues/new/choose) for your issue if there is not one already.
* Describe the issue and include steps to reproduce if it's a bug.
* Ensure to mention the earliest version that you know is affected.
* Include the RSS or atom feed if your issue is a request to add or remove.

If the issue already exists at a +1 comment to track the issues progress and alert me that it's impacting more than one user.
Please go ahead and add your info as outlined below.

## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for bug reports and features requests.

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code on any of our websites.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed/closed** &mdash; but you can still reproduce it - raise a new issue include the url to the old issue. re-opened issues will not be accepted.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; create a [reduced test
   case](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) and a live example.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS
experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these
details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to _you_ to make a strong
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Making Trivial Changes

### Typos

Please raise an issue for any typos on the site with a link to the offending page. start the first line of an issue with '(sp)' and include a url to the page in question. Language differences (e.g defense vs defence) won't be accepted.

### Documentation

For changes of a trivial nature to comments and documentation, start the first line of an issue with '(doc)'
